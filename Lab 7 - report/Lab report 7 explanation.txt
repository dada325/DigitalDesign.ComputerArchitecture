This function uses the original abs_diff function (from the helper file) three times.
Once for each color difference. The diffferences are then added together.
The main function would have to be changed to implement this function:
We would assign the left blue values to the registers 0 to 20 and the right blue values to 24 to 44 and so on..
Then a0, a1 get the values of the first color difference, a2, a3 those of the second.
The diffference of the third color is assigned to temporary registers. In this case t0 and t7.
